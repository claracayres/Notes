# What's UX?

User Experience (UX) refers to the overall experience a person has when interacting with a product, system, or service. It encompasses all aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products.

## Key Components of UX

1. **Usability** - How easy and efficient it is to use a product
2. **Accessibility** - Ensuring the product can be used by people with various abilities
3. **Information Architecture** - How information is organized and structured
4. **User Research** - Understanding user needs, behaviors, and motivations
5. **Interaction Design** - Designing interactive systems for optimal user engagement

## UX Design Process

- **Research**: Understanding users and their needs
- **Analysis**: Interpreting research data to identify patterns
- **Design**: Creating wireframes, prototypes, and solutions
- **Testing**: Validating designs with real users
- **Implementation**: Working with developers to bring designs to life

Good UX design focuses on creating products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users by considering what they need, what they value, their abilities, and their limitations.

## UX Empathy Tools and Artifacts

UX designers create various artifacts to organize and present information throughout the design process:

### User Personas
- Fictional characters representing potential users of a product
- Help teams focus on end users' needs during design
- Created through:
    - Customer interviews
    - Data-backed assumptions
    - Web analytics
- Include personal details, demographic information, needs, motivations, and pain points

### User Stories
- Brief statements describing the user and their goals
- Follow format: "As a (user type), I want (goal) for (reason)"
- Document user needs and motivations
- Help development teams estimate timelines

### Scenarios
- Situations depicting how users interact with a product
- Extensions of user stories applied to specific contexts
- Describe user motivations, goals, and possible paths to achievement
- Bridge communication gaps between creative and business thinking
- Created through scenario mapping and analysis

### Storyboards
- Visual representations of user interactions with a product
- Can be sketches, illustrations, screenshots, or interactive prototypes
- Help communicate design concepts to stakeholders
- Created by defining the persona, environment, and plot

These empathy tools help designers gather essential information about users, leading to more usable and enjoyable products that meet real user needs.
