## ✨ Purpose

To document and organize everything I’m learning or want to remember — in one place. This includes:

- Programming languages (JavaScript, Python, etc.)
- Web development
- Command-line tools & shell commands
- Git & GitHub
- Debugging and optimization tips
- APIs, databases, HTTP, REST
- Study notes (CS concepts, algorithms, etc.)
- Tools I use daily (VS Code, extensions, CLI, etc.)
- Anything else I find useful

No fancy rules — just clean, helpful notes for my future self. 🌱
